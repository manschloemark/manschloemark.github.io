		<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Mark and this is my site. I’m a programmer with an interest in low-level stuff, graphics programming, design, and programs that make our lives better. I’m in college right now and I’m looking for a software engineering internship</p>

<h2 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h2>

<p>Since I’m looking for a job I figured it would be wise to make this site. It serves as a portfolio and a good opportunity to learn something new. I’m learning how to use Jekyll because that’s what github pages recommends. So far I’m pleased with it, it’s pretty easy to use and there are some convenient features, like collections.</p>
